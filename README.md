# Text Editor Starter Code

## Description
The point of this project was to create a PWA text editor that allows the user to type code in javascript syntax and highlighting. This application also allows the user to install the app and use it offline. This project solves the issue of having to write down a block of code without being online. Throughout this project, I futhered my knowledge of building a PWA application, I learned how to use webpacks and service workers, and how to create a manifest.json file. This project was extremely helpful in furthering my coding experience and knowledge.
